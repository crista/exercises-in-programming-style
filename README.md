Exercises in Programming Style
==============================

Comprehensive collection of well-known, and not so well-known, programming
styles using a simple computational task, term frequency.

Additions are welcome! 

You can contribute: 
- an example program that follows one of the existing styles, but written in a
  different programming language 
- an entirely new programming style
- new names for the existing styles
- discussion of names, pros and cons of each style

Please follow the conventions suggested by the existing code base,
specifically:

- If you are contributing a program in a different programming language,
add that file to the corresponding style folder and call it tf-nn.ext,
where nn is the style number and ext is the language's standard
extension suffix.

- If you are contributing a new style, make a new folder called
nn-funname and add an example program in that folder called
tf-nn.ext. (nn is the next avalaible number in the collection)
Additionally, add a README.md file that clearly describes the
contraints for writing programs in that style. I will only consider
new styles corresponding to constraints that are clearly different
from the ones that already exist in the collection. (different
programs written in existing styles are exercises for students, and
should not be here)

Contributions of new names and discussion should be done under Issues
or on the Wiki part of this repo.

Never stop exercising!

Love,
Crista
