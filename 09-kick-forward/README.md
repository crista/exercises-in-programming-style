Style #9
==============================

Variation of the candy factory style, with the following additional constraints:

- Each function takes an additional parameter, usually the last, which is another function
- That function parameter is applied at the end of the current function
- That function parameter is given as input what would be the output of the current function
- Larger problem is solved as a pipeline of functions, but where the next function to be applied is given as parameter to the current function

Possible names:

- Kick your teammate forward!
- Continuation-passing style
- Crochet loop
