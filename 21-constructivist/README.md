Style #21
==============================

Constraints:

- Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its
  arguments and either returns something sensible when the arguments
  are unreasonable or assigns them reasonable values

- All code blocks check for possible errors and escape the block
  when things go wrong, setting the state to something reasonable

Possible names:

- Constructive
- Defensive
- Hopeful
- Shit happens, life goes on
