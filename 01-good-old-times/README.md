Style #1
==============================

Constraints:

- Very small amount of primary memory, typically orders of magnitude
  smaller than the data that needs to be processed/generated. 
  (The example sets the limit to 1024 cells)

- No labels -- i.e. no variable names or tagged memory addresses. All we have is
  memory that is addressable with numbers.

Possible names:

- Good old times
- Early 50s style
