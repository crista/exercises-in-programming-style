# The stop words are only 556 characters and the lines are all
# less than 80 characters, so we can use that knowledge to
# simplify the problem: we can have the stop words loaded in
# memory while processing one line of the input at a time.
# If these two assumptions didn't hold, the algorithm would
# need to be changed considerably.

# Overall strategy: (PART 1) read the input file, count the
# words, increment/store counts in secondary memory (a file)
# (PART 2) find the 25 most frequent words in secondary memory

# PART 1:
# - read the input file one line at a time
# - filter the characters, normalize to lower case
# - identify words, increment corresponding counts in file

# Load the list of stop words
