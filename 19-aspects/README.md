Style #19
==============================

Constraints:

- The problem is decomposed using some form of abstraction (procedures, functions, objects, etc.)

- Aspects of the problem are added to the main program without any
  edits to the source code of the abstractions. These side functions
  latch on the main abstractions by naming them, as in "I'm an aspect
  of foo (even though foo may not know it!)"


Possible names:

- Asides
- Aspect-oriented style
- Rewriting the story
