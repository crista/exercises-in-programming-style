Style #22
==============================

Constraints:

- Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its
  arguments and refuses to continue when the arguments are
  unreasonable

- All code blocks check for all possible errors, possibly print out
  context-specific messages when errors occur, and pass the errors
  up the function call chain

Possible names:

- Tantrum
- Design by contract
- Mental breakdown
