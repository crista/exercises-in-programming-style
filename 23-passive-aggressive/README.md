Style #23
==============================

Constraints:

- Every single procedure and function checks the sanity of its
  arguments and refuses to continue when the arguments are
  unreasonable, jumping out of the function

- When calling out other functions, program functions only check for
  errors if they are in a position to react meaningully

- Error handling occurs at higher levels of function call chains,
  wherever it is meaningul to do so

Possible names:

- Passive aggressive
- Exception
